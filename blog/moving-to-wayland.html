<p>As I'm experiencing some problems with Xorg, I will be switching to Wayland, because why not? I think it's worth to give it a try because many people are already using Wayland as their daily driver. I will make a video and a blog post about my experiences of using it and my thoughts on it. I may even use Wayland as my daily driver if I'm really liking it. Hope it will be a great experience :)</p>
