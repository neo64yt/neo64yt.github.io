    <h1>Photo Gallery</h1>
    <p>Welcome. If you are here, it means you finally unlocked the easter egg I hide. You can only access this page by going "https://neo64yt.neocities.org/gallery.html" or by accessing the not found page. Ok, here are the photos:</p>
    <h3>Neo in The Void</h3>
    <img src="img/neointhevoid.png" class="bigphoto">
    <p>This is the wallpaper I made and currently use as the main wallpaper for my dwm rice. Just simple. No circles, oval or curves.</p>
    <h3>Neo64 The 3rd</h3>
    <img src="img/oldlogo3.png" class="bigphoto">
    <p>My third old logo I made (Sorry, I lost the high resolution version :p). Based on "Neo64 The 2nd" and the black part is inspired by the design of Endermen.</p>
    <p>That's all! Now, go <a href="index.html">back</a>!</p>
