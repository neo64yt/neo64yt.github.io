<p>As I'm experiencing some problems with Xorg, I will be switching to Wayland, because why not? I think it's worth to give it a try because many people are already using Wayland as their daily driver. I will make a video and a blog post about my experiences of using it and my thoughts on it. I may even use Wayland as my daily driver if I'm really liking it. Hope it will be a great experience :)</p>

<p>I'm a little bit busy, so I don't have much time to give attention to this site. But hey, I made a little progress by adding <a href="../ontheweb.html">this page</a>. More pages will be added soon on this site, so please be patient. If I have plenty of time, I will start focusing on the development of this website (...and maybe the YAGAI project, I will write about it in the next time). Anyway, hope you enjoy visiting my website :)</p>
<small>Lol what the heck did I wrote in this post</small>
